# Hospitl_census_housing Project – Data Analysis (Team Peace)


###  Project Overview

The objective of the project is to analyze real-world datasets, answer defined business problem statements, and derive meaningful insights using **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques**.

The project follows a structured analytics workflow:
- Understanding business problem statements
- Working with raw datasets
- Cleaning and transforming data
- Performing analysis using Python
- Presenting insights through a final report

---

### Objectives
- Understand and translate business problem statements into analytical tasks
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on raw datasets
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generate insights that support data-driven decision making
- Document findings in a structured analytical report


---

### Problem Statements
File: [Problem_Statements.docx](problem_statement.docx)

This document defines analytical questions addressed in the project.  
The analysis focuses on answering these questions using data-driven techniques rather than assumptions.

### Data Description

### Raw Data
File: **`Raw Data.zip`**

- Contains original datasets before any preprocessing from kagle


### Clean Data
File: **`Clean Data.zip`**

- Cleaned and transformed version of the raw datasets
- Missing values handled
- Data types corrected
- Prepared for analysis and visualization

---

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Notebook: [Analysis_Code.ipynb](Analysis_Code.ipynb)

Key preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing and invalid values
- Removing duplicates and inconsistencies
- Standardizing column names and formats
- Transforming data into analysis-ready form

Cleaned datasets were stored separately to maintain data lineage.

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to:
- Understand data distribution and trends
- Identify patterns and anomalies
- Compare key variables relevant to the problem statements
- Support analytical conclusions with visual evidence

Common techniques used:
- Descriptive statistics
- Group-by aggregations
- Visualizations using Python libraries

---

### Analysis & Insights
The analysis focuses on:
- Answering the defined problem statements
- Identifying key trends and relationships in the data
- Translating analytical results into business-relevant insights

Findings and interpretations are documented in the final report.

### Analysis Result

Based on the analysis of demographic, housing, and healthcare infrastructure data, three Indian states have been identified as **high-priority regions for establishing new government hospitals** due to significant gaps in healthcare accessibility.

### Identified Priority Regions

**Bihar**  
Bihar has a large rural population with a critically low bed-to-population ratio. Many districts fall below recommended healthcare standards, indicating an urgent need for new hospitals to improve access to essential medical services in underserved rural areas.

**Uttar Pradesh**  
As India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh faces severe pressure on its existing healthcare infrastructure. The high population-to-bed ratio, particularly in rural regions, highlights the need for targeted investment in new hospitals to ensure adequate healthcare access for vulnerable communities.

**Assam**  
Assam shows notable disparities in healthcare access between urban and rural areas. With growing population demands and limited rural healthcare facilities, establishing new hospitals in strategically chosen rural locations is essential to ensure equitable healthcare services.

### Recommendation

The analysis recommends prioritizing **Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam** for new hospital development. Focusing on rural and underserved districts in these states will significantly improve healthcare accessibility, reduce regional disparities, and support better health outcomes for millions of citizens.  
This targeted infrastructure investment aligns with broader public health goals and promotes a more equitable healthcare system across India.
